# Terminology

## Note

A note is a container for _unstructured_ data. You can write anything into a note - a journal entry, an idea, or even a todo list - and format it using [rich text](/guide/features/rich-text). It can also become a computational object when you [invoke a script within it](/guide/scripts/running-scripts).

## Script

A script is an automated workflow. Scripts can be called individually, or combined to run more sophisticated logic. Using scripts will allow you to get the most out of Zetanote.

## Node

A node is either a note or a script.

## Tag

A tag is a container for _structured_ data. Each tag has a schema with typed fields, similar to a database [table](/guide/features/tag-tables). Tags can be used to organize nodes or store metadata about them.
