# What is Zetanote?

![Zetanote](/zetanote-banner-docs.png)

Zetanote is a note-taking app that is powered by automated workflows called [scripts](/guide/scripts/overview), thus making it a _computational_ knowledge base. As the complexity of the world evolves at an accelerating rate, we saw the need to build a tool that can help knowledge workers map their course more effectively in the vast ocean of information.

And what better way to harness complexity than programming? Programs can automate sophisticated workflows, process large amounts of data, and help you find the right information - fast. That's why we decided to infuse the power of programming into the fabric of a knowledge base.

Zetanote aims to be an instrument for overcoming knowledge anxiety - the fear that we'll never know and remember enough. Its goal is to instill the confidence that our best ideas are right at our fingertips, ready to be deployed to just about any creative project.
