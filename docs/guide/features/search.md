## Narrowing down your search

Zetanote makes it easy for you to narrow down your search by prefixing the search query with a list of tags. For example, if you're searching for "user onboarding" and would like to limit the scope of your search to notes with both the `ðŸ’» Work` and `âœ… Task` tags, you can simply type the following query into the search box:

```
#work #task user onboarding
```

::: info
Tags in the search query are case-insensitive.
