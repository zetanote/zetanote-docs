# Tag Tables

Tag tables are a powerful combination of two familiar ideas: tags and tables. In Zetanote, each tag is a table with its own set of fields. For example, when you tag a note with both `🍎 Health` and `✅ Task`, you're creating a row in each of those tag tables. While the two rows belong to different tables, they both point to the same note.

This has two important benefits. First, it makes notes more rediscoverable, as you can find the same note through multiple tables. Second, it allows you to compose structured data onto your notes. For instance, if you had one note tagged with `🍎 Health` and `✅ Task`, and another note tagged with `💻 Work` and `✅ Task`, the two notes would share the fields in the `✅ Task` table, such as "Priority" and "Done".
