# Main API

The Main API allows you to programmatically update the _state_ of your knowledge base. Using the Main API, you can:

- Easily move information around.
- Automatically organize nodes.
- Populate node metadata.

And much more.

::: info
Only the Main API writes to the Zetanote DB, and the writes happen transactionally - either they all succeed or they all fail.
