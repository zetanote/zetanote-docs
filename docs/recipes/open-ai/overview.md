# OpenAI

Using the Zeta API's [HTTP module](/guide/zeta-api/http-api/overview), you can create workflow automations that are powered by OpenAI's APIs. This allows you to easily implement custom AI features to fit your unique needs. You can even take this approach with other LLM services such as [Anthropic's APIs](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/getting-started-with-the-api).
